1. We load the image 
2. we reshape it and flattern the image 
3. then we ask k means algi th cluster pixels into 6 clusters(group pixels into 6 clusters)
4. we got good extrection in cluster 4
5. then we save the model 


6. we keep cluster 4 recorded because cluster 4 extrats good
7. we load all images into test images folder 
8. gray image as well as coloured image both will be taken here 
9. the nthe shape is taken 
10. then we flattern the image 
11. then apply to k meas and get cluster
12. cluster is flattern version since image is flatten version 
13. we convert cluster into 2d
14. throughout the cluster we are extacting pixel which equal to label 4. coz label 4 is tumor cluster 
15. we extract the  into mask 
16. mask is pixel with cluster 4 will be 1 and all other cluster will be 0 
17. then we find counters
18. hirerchy contain several counters(cv2.counter for more info about counters)it help in shape 
19. we extract conturs into small areas
20. all counter are not required.
21.  we go through each and every counter and measure area if area>1000 it will be of tumour and we draw boundry        rectangle.
